# Actions the robot can do

# Menu selections
Choose a gesture and make its role to open a menu and select what to do
Each entry in the menu specifies a framework
In each framework gestures have different meaning
The "pick" gesture is used to confirm
Look at Apple vision pro navigation system

# Frameworks
Each framework could be one of the actions the robot can do:
- move absolute
- move relative
- move joints

Inside each framework you can have a hand that specifies what dof to control, and the other to choose what to do in that dof

For example in the move joints framework I can have the left hand that selects the joint (from 0 to 5), and the right hand that somwhow selects and angle (for example mapping the thumb-index distance to 0-360 or something like that)
